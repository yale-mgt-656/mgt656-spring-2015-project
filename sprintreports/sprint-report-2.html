        <p>In Sprint 2, we completed the following activities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Designed, tested and pushed the logo image to our website.</li> 
          <li>Created the about page and included the team names and images.</li>
          <li>Added CSS styles for the about page - headlines, paragraphs and spans. </li>
          <li>Tested the about page and received success result in all three requirements.</li>
          <li>Added links to the header and footer.</li>
          <li>Decided which user stories will be completed in sprint 3.</li>
          <li>Decided which team member will be responsible for the activities in sprint 3.</li>

       <b style="text-decoration:underline">Sprint 1 Retrospective</b><br><br>
        <b><i>What went well during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
        <ol>
<li>As a team, initially we had some confusion organizing our stories but in the end, everything worked out and all the team members finished their stories on time.</li>
<li>Besides, what benefited the team is the fact that we worked physically together which increased our collaboration on the tasks. It made us feel integrated and highly motivated as we had a common goal to achieve.</li>
<li>In order to check the quality of our work and whether we are fulfilling the given requirements, we ran tests to review our code and know if we were going in the right direction. We really enjoyed helping and working with each other as well as adding our own creativity to the project.</li>
<li>We were facing some errors in our code but we all attended the TA section as a team and were able to get all our problems solved with the help of our wonderful and super helpful TAs!</li>
<li>We were able to create some <a href="#mockups">mockups</a> using Balsamiq.</li>
<li>We are starting to identify certain internal strengths and likings - such as Susana enjoys modifying CSS and everything design, Karen likes adding new HTML code and figuring out how to validate data, Mezyad is a geek for all things technical and has willingly volunteered to take up unknown stuff such as the API and Shadin likes cleaning up the code and being the "heroku master".</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="row">
        <b><i>What went wrong during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
        <ol>
          <li>We didn’t give enough feedback to each other throughout the week and hence had a lot of feedback towards the end of the sprint cycle.</li>
<li>We also didn’t schedule more meetings as per our calendars and so in the end we had to work very late.</li>
<li>We weren’t able to understand how to apply CSS styles to individual pages through the main style.css and have asked the Greg (TA) who said he would check and get back to us. </li>

        </ol>
    </div>

  
  
<div class="row">
        <b><i>What could we do differently to improve?</i></b>
        <ol>
          <li>We will give more feedback to each other by scheduling another team midweek session every Tuesday from 1 to 2pm.</li>
<li>We could work more on the look and feel of the website to make it look beautiful.</li>
<li>We could create branches to make it more structured while working on Github.</li>
<li>We could plan out our work throughout the week especially in our meetings on Tuesday and Friday.</li>
<li>We should always add any images and other data in a public folder to be visible to other users.</li>
<li>We should get our issues solved (either by asking the team or TAs) as early in the week as possible so that we can get help on time.</li>
