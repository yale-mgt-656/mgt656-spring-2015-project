Cosmic-Brook Coding Team: Sprint Six Report
December 7, 2015
</h2>
<b>Overview of Project</b>
Building an EventBrite-like site that allows people to post events and let others RSVP to them.

Meetings this Sprint
12/2/15 --  Stand up meeting (during class)
The main focus of this meeting was dealing with redirecting users to the event detail page once they’ve submitted a valid form.  No one knew how to do this, so we delegated manpower to office hours.

12/2/15 --  Sprint Planning (after-class)
We reviewed our story backlog and added some story points for completing the redirect issue.  We also realized that we needed to add some story points for addressing Kyle’s new updates to the project requirements.  After importing these updates, we had many tests failing.  Additionally, we added Google analytics functionality.
