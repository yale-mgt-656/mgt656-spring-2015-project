<b>Overview of Project</b>
Building an EventBrite-like site that allows people to post events and let others RSVP to them.
<br>

<h3>User Background & Notes on Metrics Platforms</h3>
The site launched in early November, but analytics are only available starting November 29th, once the analytic framework was set up and it first started seeing substantial visitors. From that date to December 11th, the site has seen about 8,700 visitors, with nearly all the traffic coming from users in different schools at Yale University. The breakdown of users by school is as follows: medicine (29%), divinity (5%), SOM (39%), and law (26%). Almost all of them (99.5%) were new and not returning visitors.

It should be noted that analytics were collected through two different services, Google Analytics and Optimizely. The former was used to generate aggregate data on user background and behavior, while the latter was used to run the A/B tests discussed below.

<br>
Overall User Flow
The diagram below shows the overall movement of users through the site since November 29th. 
As it shows, over 90% of the 8,700 visitors did not advance past the landing page, which was the most popular page visited. If someone did advance past this page, he or she was most likely to visit the “SOM House Party” event detail page. For a more detailed analysis of how visitors from different schools engaged with the site, see the section below called “Detailed Findings From A/B Tests.”

<h3>Overview of A/B Tests</h3>
We wanted to test whether adding “RSVP” to the SOM House Party link on the homepage would increase click thrus, so we created an A/B test in Optimizely that randomly displayed “RSVP.” To understand how this change would affect the behavior of different users (e.g. law, SOM, medicine, and divinity), we created separate experiments for each of these. Also, we set up a similar experiment to test whether “Submit” or “Donate” was more likely to encourage visitors to contribute to events.  

The results of these tests are summarized below, and subsequent sections provide more analysis. It should be noted that these tests were only created on December 9th, which means many of them did not see enough visitors to generate statistically significant results.

<b>Recommendations</b>
<br>
RSVP v. No RSVP
If given more time, we would like to run the tests a bit longer to collect conclusive evidence about click thru rates using different language in the event link. Based on the initial data collected, it appears that there are differences in click thru rates for different audiences. Therefore we would consider creating a new landing page where the audience member is directed to a unique event site based on their email address/school. For instance, SOM and medical school students should be directed to a homepage with “RSVP”, while divinity and law students should not.

Donate v. Support
If given more time, we would like to run the tests a bit longer to collect conclusive evidence about conversion rates for donate v. support.  If conversion rates for donations remained low overall, we would think about different ways to increase donations (e.g. Adding more info about where the money would go) as opposed to just changing language on the button.  

User Flow
Given the large drop off after the homepage, it’s clear that we should do more to entice people to use this site. While the A/B tests provide some instruction on what to change, it’s likely that other features of the site could be altered to improve user flow through it. For example, perhaps visitors: do not understand what the site is for, cannot find events that interest them, do not like the logo, etc. We recommend conducting small focus groups with potential users at different schools to understand what they do and do not like about the homepage, then make design and functionality adjustments accordingly. Related, we could add more features, like integration with Facebook to show profiles of attendees or integration with Google Maps to show exactly where the event is taking place. All these proposed design changes could also be vetted using A/B tests.
