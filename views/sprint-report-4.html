      <p>In Sprint 4, we completed the following activities:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The home page has a list of events</li>
        <li>The events in the home page have links to event detail pages</li>
        <li>The events have an image</li>
        <li>Events that are over are not shown</li>
        <li>Event detail pages created</li>
        <li>RSVP form on each event detail page created and tested to allow only Yale email addresses</li>
        <li>Coded form for creating new events</li>
        <li>Created the functions for validation (they work but the tests are yet to pass)</li>
        <li>If the form entries are not valid, it will show the errors</li>
        <li>Added Google Analytics tracking code to pages</li>
        
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 25px">
      <b style="text-decoration:underline">Scrum activities</b><br>
      <br> We did the following scrum activities as a part of this sprint:<br>
      <br> We had a <b>15 min scrum meeting</b> while in class last Monday (11/9) to understand what what everyone has done till now, what they will be doing then onwards and if anyone is facing obstacles. Through this meeting, we were able to resolve big issue in integrating the validation branch as app was crashing everytime.<br>
      <br> We had a <b>sprint planning meeting</b> this Monday (11/16) to understand the additional requirements that were made part of the project:
        <ul>
          <li>We looked at the user stories in the email by Prof Kyle Jensen and then broke those down into smaller stories to follow the <b>INVEST</b> criteria. </li>
          <li>We then estimated the size of each of these stories through a round of <b>planning poker</b>.</li>
          <li>Each of us took up the tasks we want to work on for the next sprint</li>
          <li>All the stories for this feature has been uploaded to Waffle.io so that we can keep a track of where we are.</li>
        </ul>
      <br> We also did a sprint retrospective and released working code to Heroku.
      <br><br>
      <b style="text-decoration:underline">Sprint 4 Retrospective</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><i>What went well during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>We fixed several pieces of code on the Home and About pages so the tests pass. This was because we were more focused on coding up the features rather than checking every single test.</li>
        <li>We used branches and pull requests and thus had no issues with merging code, unlike the previous sprint.</li>
        <li>We managed to finish some tasks in less time than expected such as (deleting old events) and we used this time to start the unexpected new tasks (Google Analytics tracking code).</li>
        
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <b><i>What went wrong during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>We spent more time on making tests pass than on coding new things</li>
        <li>We are having trouble and feeling a bit desperate because some functions are working but still the test doesn’t pass and we don’t know why (form validation). We have had to give more time to this task in the next sprint which was unplanned. </li>
        <li>The new tasks added in the middle of our workload created a disruption to the plans we already had. As you can see in the graph the expectation is that we will not be able to finish the project on time (Pessimistic estimation)</li>

      </ol>
    </div>



    <div class="row">
      <b><i>What could we do differently to improve?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>From the beginning of our coding we should make sure that tests pass so we don’t lose extra time fixing code later</li>
        <li>Create more pull requests even if they are small commits instead of committing a whole chunk of code at the end</li>
        <li>Agree on meeting at least once a week</li>
        <li>We should be better prepared to receive more unexpected tasks from the stakeholders during our process</li>

      </ol>
