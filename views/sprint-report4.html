            <h4>Quick Snapshot: Where the Project Stands at the End of Sprint #4</h4>
            <p><b>What we’re doing: </b> Our team is creating a website that is essentially a clone of Eventbrite. The site allows users to create new events and post them to the site. It also allows users to view upcoming events and RSVP to those that interest them, provided they have a Yale e-mail address. <br>
              The team had a really productive sprint this week. Of the 39 tests we run for the site, only 2 are not yet passing! Here is a  <a href="https://mgt656-spring-giant.herokuapp.com/">link</a> to the home page. You’ll notice that:<Br>
                  - Upcoming events appear on the homepage, and past events do not. <Br>
                  - Each event links to an<a href="https://mgt656-spring-giant.herokuapp.com/"> event detail page </a>that includes pertinent information about the event. <Br>
                  - The event detail page also allows a user to RSVP for the event, provided the user has a Yale e-mail address.<Br>
                  - All non-Yale e-mail addresses produce an error message when they try to RSVP: <Br>

                  - You probably won’t notice this, but when you visit the page <a href="https://mgt656-spring-giant.herokuapp.com/api/events"> /api/events </a>you’ll retrieve an object with key events containing all events in JSON format.<br><br>
                  You’ll also notice some things that aren’t quite up to snuff yet:<br>
                  - With the exception of the “About” page, the format of the site is pretty basic. This was a strategic decision on the part of the team, as we wanted to get the functionality of the site down before we expand on its visual appeal.<br>
                  <b>Burn Down Chart:</b><br><img src="/images/s4i2.png"></img><br>
                  <b>**Legend: Each red diamond marks the end of a sprint</b><br>
                  <i>Note: The burn down chart has a relatively small number of stories because we kept our stories general enough to encapsulate several smaller “tasks.” The number of stories increases periodically (typically at the beginning of a sprint) because either new requirements come in from management or the team discusses past stories in greater detail and decides to expand them into multiple stories. This was the case for the past sprint: even though we completed 8 stories, new requirements from management were added to the backlog, we created some new user stories, and we only “netted” 3 stories.</i><br>

                 <h4>Recap of the week’s sprint</h4>
                  Scrum meetings: <br>
                  - Tuesday, November 10<br>
                  - Wednesday, November 11<br>
                  - Monday, November 16<br>
                  The team met several times this week, which helped our productivity. Our Tuesday meeting was our longest of the week, and we spent the bulk of the time reviewing the previous week’s sprint. We decided to include all of our comments and notes on progress for our user stories on Waffle.io. We had previously been using a Google Document to communicate our overall progress. We committed to evening out the work so that each person was devoting 2 to 6 hours of time to the sprint. We also reaffirmed our commitment to building the functionality of the site--its basic architecture--before working on the style and user experience aspects. We had less time to go over our plans for the upcoming sprint, but we were able to dole out individual assignments. As a result, our site now passes almost all of the required tests. Our communication was much better, and every member of the team completed a user story during the sprint. For the past week, Lea was the scrum master and Jeff was the product owner. <br>
                  We treated the subsequent meetings as stand-up meetings, and we were able to clarify our assignments and troubleshoot any issues we were having.<br>
                  The biggest challenge we’re facing is finding the time for two things:<br>
                  1. To express our expectations for ourselves, each other, and the group. There’s still some conflicts about how much we should be doing each week and our overall goals for the project. Our next scrum meeting will take some time to give everyone a chance to chime in about these topics.<br>
                  2. Creating new, slightly more detailed user stories with regards to the new requirements and our vision for the site’s visual style and user experience. <br>
                  We’ve put these things at the top of our agenda for our next big scrum meeting. Still, we’ve made major progress, and we’re really happy with how things are going. <br><br>
                  
                  <h4>Focus for Sprint #5</h4>These are the story points we will aim to complete for the upcoming week. We will add more stories to the backlog once we hold our discussions:<br>
