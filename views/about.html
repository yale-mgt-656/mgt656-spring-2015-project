<p>Team Deep Thought holds sprint meeting every Wednesday from 4-5pm at the Center for Engineering, Innovation, and Design.
In the first week we finished all of the assigned stories, and worked ahead on those we felt most important. This week we 
assigned ourselves new stories to tackle. UX occured in iterations- first making it sleek, and then deciding to make it ironic.
UX is now based off of "the most hipster" concept. Stories covered include changing of the design, changing of event titles,
addition of new events, and tampering with attendees. About us photos also changed.
</p>
<p>Also created this week was a link to "new new" forms and the ability to RSVP. There was a bit of a stumbling block with 
making sure that any capitalizations would still be accepted as the correct email address. We solved this with a bit of 
javascript. We also had a bit of an issue because the bar to enter in the email was the same color as the text. This bug
was resolved. We also coded such that users could retrieve API in JSON format. Also all issues with validation were clarified.
</p>
	<p> Team Deep Thought is now wrangling with the curveball of analytics and figuring out why certain mocha tests don't pass. We
	learned that changing an html tag from "h1" to "h2" affected whether or not the test passed. Aesthetic changes are now tested
	more carefully. All branches are tested at least once by another member of the team before merging.
