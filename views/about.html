She designed a simulation of a chemical process using complex computer languages while in engineering school. After writing 50 pages of code for a very boring chemical engineering project, Megha realized that she wanted to use her coding skills to do something more relevant in today's world. She met Jeff, Lea and Jared while in Yale and decided to launch an online Events website with them.</div></div>
