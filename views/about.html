  <div class="about_image"><img src="/images/megha_about.jpg" id="powerful-fox-headshot"></img><div class="about_description"><span id="powerful-fox-name"><b>Megha Ghildyal</b></span>: Megha is a second year student at the Yale School of Management and started coding when she was 3. She designed a simulation of a chemical process using complex computer languages while in engineering school. After writing 50 pages of code for a very boring chemical engineering project, Megha realized that she wanted to use her coding skills to do something more relevant in today's world. She met Jeff, Lea and Jared while in Yale and decided to launch an online Events website with them.</div></div>

When he's not coding, he enjoys running, cycling, and swimming. But not triathlons! He hates triathlons. He wanted to use his coding skills to make an events web site that would NOT allow for the creation of triathlon events. Honestly, triathlons. What a dumb idea. He knew he couldn't make a site on his own. Luckily, he met Megha, Lea, and Jared while in Yale and decided to launch an online Events website with them.</div></div>
