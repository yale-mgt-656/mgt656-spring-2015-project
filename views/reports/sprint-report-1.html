<h1>Half Mountain</h1>

<h2>Sprint Report 1</h2>

<h2>Burndown Chart</h2>

<p>Burn-Up chart available at the following link:
https://waffle.io/half-mountain/mgt656-fall-2015-project/metrics</p>

<h2>Stories Completed</h2>

<p>Assign (fluid) team roles - front-end, back-end, design, “PM”, Scrum Master
Set up team organization on Github
Set up team on Waffle
Set up team on Slack for group communication
Create product backlog and perform Fibonacci costing exercise</p>

<h2>Stuff We Did Since Last Time</h2>

<p>We created an organization for our team and got the repo working. We also signed up for associated services (Waffle and Slack because we wanted to have a team chat). Most of us got the Cloud9 environments up and running as well and we looked at the starter code to determine what to do. </p>

<p>The main exercise we did this sprint was first to determine what our user stories were. This was not as easy as thought as we had to decide on a level of granularity that would give us enough to work with, but not overwhelm us with small technical details like which tags to assign to which elements. We arrived at this based on the project description, but we also made some changes to make the stories more user-focused (e.g. “As a user, I can learn about the company“ instead of the original description which was more focused on the technical aspect of it). Next we performed the Fibonacci costing exercise, which showed large disparities in the relative difficulty each of us felt should be assigned to design vs. code, for example. In addition, we added a user story focusing on the design of the webpage, such that any user visiting the url at / can see a website that looks good. This necessitates styling work that is decoupled from the content of the webpage, which deserves its own story points. </p>

<p>We are going to use Waffle to help with making the burndown chart and have assigned sizes to every issue. We assigned a default cost of 1 to everything in our backlog that was not immediately scheduled for the next sprint because we felt that we would have a better sense of how long things will take after we have completed a sprint, and can evaluate our progress in the sprint retrospective.</p>
