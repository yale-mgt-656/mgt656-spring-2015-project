<h2>Completed Stories in Sprint 2</h2>

<ol>
<li>As any user, I can visit the url at ‘/’ and see the homepage (size = 1).</li>
<li>The homepage should have an unordered list of events (size = 5).</li>
<li>The homepage should have a time tag for each event (size = 3).</li>
<li>The homepage should have a link for each event (size = 2).</li>
<li>The homepage should not show outdated events (size = 2).</li>
<li>The homepage should have a link to create a new event (this link does not yet have to be working) (size = 2).</li>
<li>The homepage should have a team logo (size = 1).</li>
<li>As a user, I can use your API at /api/events (size = 6).  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Accomplishments, Challenges, and Roadblocks</h2>

<p>In our sprint planning meeting, we collectively sized each of the stories we sought to accomplish during Sprint 2, moving them from the product backlog to the “ready” workflow in Waffle.io. From there, we assigned each of these stories amongst all five members of our team. Some team members took ownership of one large story (e.g. “API should return an array of upcoming events in JSON format”), while other team members were assigned several smaller stories (e.g. many components of the homepage stories). This gave us a clear sense of what code we were each responsible for writing over the course of the week.</p>

<p>Throughout the sprint, we communicated using a team chat on Slack. By documenting our work in Waffle.io, we each received e-mail updates of the stories that our teammates had moved from “in progress” to “done” in the workflow. All of us were able to set up our Cloud9 environments, familiarize ourselves with the starter code, and run working applications on our computers. </p>

<p>One challenge we did not take into account at the beginning of the sprint the set-up time necessary for everyone to get on the same page in terms of familiarity with the models-views-controllers structure and the code contained within each of components. We mistakenly frontloaded the project with a heavy size of stories without accounting for this initial time of getting our feet wet in the code. In order to work through questions and bugs, we utilized both the Slack group chat and short in-person meetings to identify our blockers and help each other get unblocked. </p>

<p>Through this process, we were able to accomplish several small stories that summed up to a functional homepage. After running the tests, the code at the end of this sprint was able to pass all tests related to the homepage. The path at ‘/’ led to the homepage, which displayed an unordered list of events with correct time tags and a link for further details. The homepage excluded events that had already passed, and included a placeholder team logo (until a new one is designed) and a link to create a new event.</p>

<h2>Product Backlog (in the order they will be completed)</h2>

<ol>
<li>API: As a user, I can use your API at /api/events.</li>
<li>About: As a user, I can learn about the company through an About page.</li>
<li>Design: As any user, I can visit the url at / and see a website that looks good.</li>
<li>Details: As any user, I can see event details on a separate page when I click on an event.</li>
<li>RSVP: As an attendee, I can visit the event detail page to RSVP for an event.</li>
<li>New: As a user I can create new events.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Progress Expected by Next Sprint</h2>

<ol>
<li>API should allow for searching events by title.</li>
<li>About page should have headshots, tagged correctly.</li>
<li>About page should have each of our names, tagged correctly.</li>
<li>A team logo should be designed.</li>
<li>All pages should be using Bootstrap CSS.</li>
<li>All pages should have a link to /about in the footer</li>
<li>Event details (title, date, # of people, photo) should be displayed on a separate page when an event is clicked on the homepage.</li>
</ol>




<h2>Sprint Report 1</h2>

<p>October 27, 2015</p>

<h2>Burndown Chart</h2>

<p>Burn-Up chart available at the following link:

<h2>Stories Completed</h2>

<p>Assign (fluid) team roles - front-end, back-end, design, “PM”, Scrum Master
Set up team organization on Github
Set up team on Waffle
Set up team on Slack for group communication
Create product backlog and perform Fibonacci costing exercise</p>

<h2>Stuff We Did Since Last Time</h2>

<p>We created an organization for our team and got the repo working. We also signed up for associated services (Waffle and Slack because we wanted to have a team chat). Most of us got the Cloud9 environments up and running as well and we looked at the starter code to determine what to do. </p>

<p>The main exercise we did this sprint was first to determine what our user stories were. This was not as easy as thought as we had to decide on a level of granularity that would give us enough to work with, but not overwhelm us with small technical details like which tags to assign to which elements. We arrived at this based on the project description, but we also made some changes to make the stories more user-focused (e.g. “As a user, I can learn about the company“ instead of the original description which was more focused on the technical aspect of it). Next we performed the Fibonacci costing exercise, which showed large disparities in the relative difficulty each of us felt should be assigned to design vs. code, for example. In addition, we added a user story focusing on the design of the webpage, such that any user visiting the url at / can see a website that looks good. This necessitates styling work that is decoupled from the content of the webpage, which deserves its own story points. </p>

<p>We are going to use Waffle to help with making the burndown chart and have assigned sizes to every issue. We assigned a default cost of 1 to everything in our backlog that was not immediately scheduled for the next sprint because we felt that we would have a better sense of how long things will take after we have completed a sprint, and can evaluate our progress in the sprint retrospective.</p>
