<h2>Sprint Report 3</h2>

<p>November 9, 2015</p>

<br>
<h3>Burn-Up Chart</h3>

<p>Instead of using a burndown chart, we have decided to use the burn-up chart because it is integrated with Waffle, our primary method of tracking our workflow. The x-axis is time passed week-by-week, where each column represents one sprint. The y-axis is the number of story points completed during each sprint. Note that throughput is measured by the number of story points completed rather than the number of stories completed. The number of story points associated with each story is documented on our Waffle story cards, so closing those issues on Waffle adds those story points automatically to our burn-up chart.</p>

<p>The below burn-up chart can also be found at the following link: https://waffle.io/half-mountain/mgt656-fall-2015-project/metrics/throughput</p>

<h3>Accomplishments, Challenges, and Roadblocks</h3>

<p>In our sprint planning meeting, we collectively sized each of the stories we sought to accomplish during Sprint 3, moving them from the product backlog to the “ready” workflow in Waffle.io. We assigned story points to the stories we planned to complete in this sprint through planning poker. From there, we assigned each of these stories amongst all five members of our team. Each member took ownership of one of the following categories: Header/Footer, Event Details page, About page, API, and overall Design. Our Waffle board with our full product backlog and the stories we completed so far can be found at the following link: https://waffle.io/half-mountain/mgt656-fall-2015-project.</p>

<p>We emulated the agile methodology of having a daily standup through two team coding sessions, two in-person meetings during class, and our team chat on Slack. On Monday and Wednesday, we had our standup meeting during the team project work time in class. On Friday and Sunday, we organized a team coding sessions during which we took the time to code individually, bounce questions off of each other, work through our blockers, and talk through our vision and ideas for the project and how we could implement them. On the days where we did not meet in person, we had our daily standup through Slack. As an example, here is a screenshot of the beginning of a team discussion we had on Slack about logo designs. We went through five iterations of the logo, adjusting the design based on team feedback after each iteration. These five versions of the logo are also included below.</p>

<br>
<p>One development challenge we faced was dealing with bugs that were remnant from past sprints. This was our first substantial encounter with bugs in the project. When we wrote the code for the header and footer elements, footer links, and bootstrapping every page, we found that the tests for these elements all failed. Originally assigned a single story point each, these stories ended up cumulatively taking over 2.5 hours to diagnose and fix the bug. It turned out that the code we had written in layout.html was not executing on all the pages. We realized it was because some of the code written in the prior sprint by another teammate had been blocking the layout.html code from executing on the event detail pages. We were able to identify this issue during our last coding session, and ultimately, we were able to work collectively as a group to fix the error and pass the tests for the header, footer, and bootstrap elements. Enabling the API to search for events also posed a technical challenge: one of our team members had to set up a separate controller for the API without having any template to follow. That aside, we were able to figure out the filtering / querying aspect of the API searching function in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Another challenge we faced was one we actually saw earlier in class, during the session on UX/design with Heather Cassano from Google. Much like the "design a stop sign" video we watched where stakeholders continually made suggestions to the designer based on their own ideas of what a good design was, we also faced a conflict when the first logos our designer proposed were met with team opinions like "looks too 90s", "but gradients are coming back into style", "can it be more fun?" etc. These comments ended up being constructive feedback that allowed us to iterate on the design of the logo, and we were able to unanimously agree on one design as the one we wanted to move forward with. The design we voted on as a team is the one below (note that the design is still not finalized):</p>

</center>
<br>
<p>A final challenge we confronted was the result of a misunderstanding of what the stakeholders wanted (as expressed in the user stories) and how the developers interpreted those requirements. When working on the About page, we misinterpreted correctly tagging each photo as tagging it with our team name (half-mountain) rather than each person’s individual class nickname. The team member working on this user story committed without running the test, and ultimately had to rewrite the code once we realized what the tagging requirement truly meant. This experience solidified the practice of frequently testing our code before we committed any changes we made.</p>

<p>In this sprint, we were able to accomplish several stories in five different categories: Header/Footer, Event Details page, About page, API, and overall Design. All pages now include a header with the new team logo, and a footer with links to the Homepage and the About page. When an event is clicked on the Homepage, a new Event Details page loads giving the title, date, number of attendees, and a photo of the event. We now have a fleshed-out About page with profile pictures and each team member’s name. The API now allows searching for events by title. Finally, we have added Bootstrap to all pages, and have designed a new team logo and added a favicon.</p>

<h3>Burndown Chart</h3>

<p>Burn-Up chart available at the following link:

<h3>Completed Stories in Sprint 2</h3>

<ol>
<li>As any user, I can visit the url at ‘/’ and see the homepage (size = 1).</li>
<li>The homepage should have an unordered list of events (size = 5).</li>
<li>The homepage should have a time tag for each event (size = 3).</li>
<li>The homepage should have a link for each event (size = 2).</li>

<li>The homepage should have a team logo (size = 1).</li>
<li>As a user, I can use your API at /api/events (size = 6).  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Accomplishments, Challenges, and Roadblocks</h3>

<p>In our sprint planning meeting, we collectively sized each of the stories we sought to accomplish during Sprint 2, moving them from the product backlog to the “ready” workflow in Waffle.io. From there, we assigned each of these stories amongst all five members of our team. Some team members took ownership of one large story (e.g. “API should return an array of upcoming events in JSON format”), while other team members were assigned several smaller stories (e.g. many components of the homepage stories). This gave us a clear sense of what code we were each responsible for writing over the course of the week.</p>

<p>Throughout the sprint, we communicated using a team chat on Slack. By documenting our work in Waffle.io, we each received e-mail updates of the stories that our teammates had moved from “in progress” to “done” in the workflow. All of us were able to set up our Cloud9 environments, familiarize ourselves with the starter code, and run working applications on our computers. </p>

<p>One challenge we did not take into account at the beginning of the sprint the set-up time necessary for everyone to get on the same page in terms of familiarity with the models-views-controllers structure and the code contained within each of components. We mistakenly frontloaded the project with a heavy size of stories without accounting for this initial time of getting our feet wet in the code. In order to work through questions and bugs, we utilized both the Slack group chat and short in-person meetings to identify our blockers and help each other get unblocked. </p>

<p>Through this process, we were able to accomplish several small stories that summed up to a functional homepage. After running the tests, the code at the end of this sprint was able to pass all tests related to the homepage. The path at ‘/’ led to the homepage, which displayed an unordered list of events with correct time tags and a link for further details. The homepage excluded events that had already passed, and included a placeholder team logo (until a new one is designed) and a link to create a new event.</p>

<h2>Sprint Report 1</h2>

<p>October 27, 2015</p>

<h3>Burndown Chart</h3>

<p>Burn-Up chart available at the following link:
https://waffle.io/half-mountain/mgt656-fall-2015-project/metrics</p>

<h3>Stories Completed</h3>

<p>Assign (fluid) team roles - front-end, back-end, design, “PM”, Scrum Master
Set up team organization on Github
Set up team on Waffle
Set up team on Slack for group communication
Create product backlog and perform Fibonacci costing exercise</p>

<h3>Stuff We Did Since Last Time</h3>

<p>We created an organization for our team and got the repo working. We also signed up for associated services (Waffle and Slack because we wanted to have a team chat). Most of us got the Cloud9 environments up and running as well and we looked at the starter code to determine what to do. </p>

<p>The main exercise we did this sprint was first to determine what our user stories were. This was not as easy as thought as we had to decide on a level of granularity that would give us enough to work with, but not overwhelm us with small technical details like which tags to assign to which elements. We arrived at this based on the project description, but we also made some changes to make the stories more user-focused (e.g. “As a user, I can learn about the company“ instead of the original description which was more focused on the technical aspect of it). Next we performed the Fibonacci costing exercise, which showed large disparities in the relative difficulty each of us felt should be assigned to design vs. code, for example. In addition, we added a user story focusing on the design of the webpage, such that any user visiting the url at / can see a website that looks good. This necessitates styling work that is decoupled from the content of the webpage, which deserves its own story points. </p>

<p>We are going to use Waffle to help with making the burndown chart and have assigned sizes to every issue. We assigned a default cost of 1 to everything in our backlog that was not immediately scheduled for the next sprint because we felt that we would have a better sense of how long things will take after we have completed a sprint, and can evaluate our progress in the sprint retrospective.</p>
