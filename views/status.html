<p dir="ltr">We were done with most of the user stories by the end of sprint #2 and all the tests were passing. In sprint #3, we focused on understanding the behaviour of users through the implementation of Google Analytics. </p>

<p dir="ltr"><u>Project Retrospective</u></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">Although we had initially experienced technical challenges, we were able to find a way to progress within the project. We only led one team member to push and commit all the changes to master branch on git and heroku as such system assured the healthy functionality of the end product at all times. We are aware that such collaboration would not work in a large scale &amp; scope project, but we figured it would work for a small project. Even having the code sent my e-mail helped us at early times when some team members did not know how to commit changes on git. Once the project and user stories got more technical, astute members of our team such as Burak handled most of the technical issues and pushed most of the versions to the heroku. On the other hand, Cong and Hikmetcan focused on getting ready for sprints, updating the kanban board, and feeding the updates about the curveballs to appropriate team member.</p>

<br>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Traffic Analysis &amp; A/B Testing Analysis</u></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">There is still no winner for both of our A/B testings. Our RSVP A/B testing had a slightly higher conversion rate (12.32% vs. 11.39%). However the rate of traffic has been increasing. We had 3,055 sessions (1,849 direct/1,206 referral). The conversion of referrals are clearly higher (8.37% vs. 4.81%), which implies that referrals are better source of incoming traffic for us.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Besides the direct traffic, the biggest chunk of source is coming through yale.edu, followed by som.yale.edu (See below for all sources)</p>

<p dir="ltr"><u>What&rsquo;s Next?</u></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">We are still working on the design and layout of the website. After understanding the A/B testing behavior (Still no winner), we hope to look for ways to optimize the bounce rate and offer functionalities to better serve such needs. We hope to be acquired within the next 5 years by Eventbrite itself!!! </p>
