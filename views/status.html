<p>On day 1, we made several bug fixes we discovered from our last sprint. On days 2-5, we did not make signficant progress on the project. In fact, on day 5 we received a curve ball from the instructors that increased our product backlog. On day 6 we made herculean progress with the team firing on all cylinders. We wrapped up remaining items on our sprint backlog list during the final day of the sprint.</p>     

<h3>Sprint Completed Stories</h3>
<ul>1. Bug fix for homepage logo (now on cloud server)</ul>
<ul>2. Bug fix for about page photos</ul>
<ul>3. Bug  fix for about page name</ul>
<ul>4. Status link added to pages for accessing project report</ul>
<ul>5. Install Google Analytics</ul>
<ul>6. Events list added to homepage</ul>
<ul>7. Event links on homepage</ul>
<ul>8. Hide old events on homepage</ul>
<ul>9. Create form for new event that allows for event name, location, image, year, month, day, hour, and minute</ul>
<ul>10. Create pull down menu for year, month, day, hour, minute</ul>
<ul>11. Create submit button for new event</ul>
<ul>12. Validate new event form entries (event name, location, image, year, month, day, hour, minute)</ul>
<ul>13. API returns events in JSON format and allows for searching</ul>
<ul>14. RSVP function that allows users to send RSVPs</ul>
<ul>15. RSVP function that allows for validating RSVPS</ul>

<p>After having straightened out various collaboration and workflow issues in the first sprint, we spent this sprint focusing on the path ahead and grooming the product backlog. Since we tackled some of the easier HTML pieces during our first sprint, we priorititized site functionality (listing of events on homepage, creating new events on new event page, linking to new events, the API, etc.). We also incorporated several small bug fixes from the previous sprint and the curve ball provided by the instructors into our product backlog. Story points fell into two major buckets--html/css heavy and javascript based--and so we tried to have each team member pull from the backlog strategically based on relative strenths. </p>

<h3>Product Backlog</h3>
<ul>1. Bug fixes from previous sprint</ul>
<ul>2. Change layout.html styling</ul>
<ul>3. Change homepage styling</ul>
<ul>4. Change about page sytling</ul>

<p>After completing the main functionality elements of the site, we plan to evaluate whether there are any bugs and fix them as well as turn to the site UX, including updating the layout.html page, homepage, and about page. We want our site to more aesthetically pleasing!</p>
